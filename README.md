# Advent of Code

## aoc_lib

`aoc_lib` is the library module containing assorted classes and functions that I have found useful in 
solving these problems. In addition it contains the `solve_problem` code that actually runs the problems.

`_template.py` is the template for a new problem file.

## Year folders

The year folders contain the solutions for the 25 problems from the given year. In the 
`problem_definitions` folder you can find the problem definitions (along with the 
correct answers) for the problems.
